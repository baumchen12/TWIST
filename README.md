A list of students you collaborated with on this project:
                    Dan Balaun, Wes Nelson, & Terrill Leaton
                    
Description of the main learning objectives for this project:
  -Front End Development
  We needed to learn and understand the front end development of how a project as such works and operates together. Front end development in this project dealt more with CSS in the style sheet along with pug. Because we did not understand pug quite as much we were able to use a pug to html converter to use which was very handy in the front end development process. I was able to more about pug while doing so too.
  
  -Admin Section Creation 
    This section was mostly involved with the back end development. This consisted of learning and understanding how the controllers, models, routes, etc.. all working together to perform the actions of the admin section which meant allowing the admin to create, update, and delete the different items such as sessions, rooms, presenters, etc...
    
  -Add In Registration Forms
    This included learning and understanding how to connect your code from one section to another. The most difficult and challenging part of this section involved using same variables and same capitalization so your code in one section works when linked and connected to another. This would be like if you are trying to use a controller thats linked in with another controller to help provide for the registration forms.
  
  -Back End Development
    As already explained above in the admin section creation, this involved the overall creation of the controllers, models, views, routes, installing all the dependencies, the public folder which includes the Style Sheet alongside with the used images and other created files such as the package.json.

A clear description of what you contributed to this project:
    -As a group we didn't communicate like we needed to so starting out we all had our own code that we were working on. I had created the skeleton for the website and had this portion along with the controllers already created. Because Terrill already had more than everyone in the group we went ahead and used his code for the back end portion. After finishing up with the back end and making some finishing touches we dove into the front end aspect of the project. I was able to do a lot of work and spent a lot of time on this portion of the project since it was more of my strong suit due to me being a digital media major. On my own I was able to create the light grey background, the black top bar for a finishing touch and the last thing consisted of a majority of my team. That was taking images off the internet and editing them in photoshop to give the pictures more of a "Kansas State" feel with the overlaying purple and such. As a group we worked together to figure out how to change all text to kansas state purple.

Description of challenges that you ran into and the process of how you worked through the issues:
    -Async 
    The Async problem was quickly resolved with the help of our wonderful professor.
    
    -Branch Collaboration Issues on GitHub
    This was a slight struggle at a certain moment or two. I was new to the branch process so it was a huge learning curve for me during the group project. I was able to work through this challenge with the help of my knowledgable group.
    
    -Populate Participants and schools? Just participants or just schools? 
    Populating one or the other was another challenge that was quickly solved after getting help from another student in which we were lucky.
    
    -Bootstrap
    I would technically count this as a challenge since I knew how to use bootstrap to an extent. Sometimes the code wouldn't work because of how our back end was set up so it was a matter of trial and error of using different codes from different examples.
    
    
List features that are incomplete or need improvements if given more time:
    -There were a few items on the front end that I didn't have quite enough time to finish or couldn't figure out. This was the hamburger drop down menu when the size of the window is down to either tablet screen size or phone screen size. To elaborate on this more, I couldn't figure out how to move it to the left side of the screen as well as droping down to show the different buttons such as the home button and the drop down menus for an easier navigation. Another item that I was having troubles with was figuring out how to make images disappear when viewing the site on mobile. The last thing that I struggled with was the fact that I couldn't figure out how to make the footer work. It didn't want to work right for me when I was trying to input it into my code which is why I left it out of the final project. 

Reflection on how you would approach this project differently if you were to start over:
    If I had to approach this differently then I would definetly try to take a bit more of a leadership role and take more action. We were all a bit shy starting out so from the start we were all doing different things. We should have met outside of class at the start to decide on what we needed to do exactly. I also think we could have communicated more at the start which we hadn't done much of.
